First exercise in an "almost-CRUD". This library app allows users to create, read, update (to some extent) and delete references to books. This was my first project that involved manipulations of objects.

NOTE: due to Git errors, previous versions of this project were lost. This version was originally uploaded on March 13th.

FURTHER CHANGES
1. Refactor the javascript - use helper functions
2. Make the opacity of the background change without changing the opacity of the form
3. Check if the book has already been added and return error message if so
4. Make the Log In button functional (accounts)
5. Add :hover pseudoclasses to the buttons
6. Change readButton to a toggle button
